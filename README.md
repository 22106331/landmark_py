Landmark with Regressition in Python
====
Now It's only supported LBF(Local Binary Features) regression and ALFW dataset.      

#### __Dependencies__    
---    
* python2.7    
* numpy    
* scipy    
* scikit-learn    

#### __Usage__    
---    

#### __TODO__    
--- 
* [TODO] Support `Explicit Shape Regression`    
* [TODO] Try random ferns instead of random forest    
* [TODO] Try different interpolations when computing `Pixel Difference Feature`      
* [TODO] Try finding the best split when training Random Forest. Now using random split
